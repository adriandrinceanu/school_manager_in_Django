A Django School Management Project with a complete front-end. This project is for practicing my Python coding. I included a grade prediction functionality which I think it's a great touch.

A complex school manager with the following logic:
    - The Principal can view Teachers, Students, Student's Parents, School years, Curriculum, Grades and has admin privileges over them
    - The Teachers can view their students, and have access to their grades, parents, curriculum.
    - The Students can view their grades, Homework and teachers
    - The Parents cand view their child's grades, teachers and curriculum
    
Functionalities:
    - best student per teacher
    - best student per year
    - best student by class/group
    - Grade prediction per student
    - Teachers with the most top students
    - Top 10 Students
    - Top 100 Students
    - Best class
    - Top classes
    - Top teachers
    -
